# About
The [unruptured intracranial aneurysm treatment score (UIATS)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4560059/) is a model that attempts to quantify, classify and assign scores to key factors that influence the treatment of patients with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm. This project attempts to extend the UIATS by using fuzzy set membership functions to smooth out the scoring.
